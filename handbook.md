1. The Policies of the Kingdom Earl Marshal

    This document incorporates the policies and rules for all marshal activities, not just Armored Combat.  All previous documents for sports other than Armored Combat are null and void.
    1. General Policies
        1.  Scope and Validity
            1.  This document delineates the rules and regulations that govern the marshaling of combat in Atlantia.
            1.  All combat and animal activities must be conducted according to the policies defined in this document.
                1.  Combat Disciplines are Armored Combat, Combat Archery, Rapier Combat, Target Archery, and Thrown Weapons.
                1.  Animal Disciplines are Equestrian Activities and Hounds.
                1.  All activities under these categories must be supervised by a marshal warranted by the Atlantian Earl Marshal's Office to do so.
        1.  General Responsibilities
            1.  Safety must be the primary concern of all Marshals. If a safety problem arises through the rules, the Marshal must halt the activity until a safe way can be found to conduct the activity.  If this happens, the Marshal In Charge of Events must report this as a serious problem, following the procedures defined in Problem Resolution section, including the nature of the conflict between rules and safety, the resolution at the event, and the other Marshals present.
            1.  The Marshals must enforce rules evenhandedly, regardless of the rank, affiliation, or degree of rudeness of the fighters involved.
            1.  All Marshals must conduct themselves in a safe, courteous, and controlled fashion.
            1.  In any contact discipline that includes projectile weapons, the Marshals must wear shatterproof sports or industrial high impact plastic eye protection.
            1.  Marshals are expected to contribute to the rules modification process by suggesting improvements or commenting on proposed changes to Policies and Conventions.
        1.  The Structure of the Marshallate There are 3 basic levels of marshal:
            * Kingdom Level:  (this includes the Earl Marshal, and all Deputy Earl Marshals (DEM)).
            * Group Level:  (this includes the group Knight's Marshal (KM) and all of his or her Deputies (DKM)).
            * Bottom Level:  (this includes all Apprentice Marshals (MIT) and Crowd Control Assistants (CCA, Line Marshals, etc.)

            There is a DEM for each sanctioned marshal activity.  They report directly to the Earl Marshal and to a Corporate Officer (if one exists in that role) and have no direct reports save any regional deputies that they may create to aid them. Their role is to oversee all aspects of that activity, recommend scenarios to the Group Level Marshals, recommend rules changes to the Earl Marshal, work with the DEM for Training to create and maintain appropriate training materials. The Group Level marshals report directly to the Earl Marshal for the purposes of submitting event reports and reporting problems.  They should seek advice on the design of scenarios from the DEM of their activity as needed and recommend rules and training changes to them as well.
            1.  The Types of Marshals and their Responsibilities
                1.  Earl Marshal (EM, KEM)
                    1.  The Earl Marshal shall be responsible for the formulation, publication, and distribution of the rules of all activities and the marshal's policies.  The Earl Marshal may delegate to one or more deputies for this purpose, but the ultimate responsibility lies with the Earl Marshal.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must conduct appropriate review of sanctions imposed by the Marshal In Charge of an Event (MIC).  The participants must be notified within five (5) business days of receiving of the report, or appeal, whichever arrived first.  The participants must be informed of the status of the investigation - closed and upheld, closed and overturned, or pending further investigation, with an explanation of the reason for delaying a decision.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must submit required reports to the Society Earl Marshal.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must meet the Marshal's mandate established in Kingdom Law and must meet the requirements of the Corporate Policy and those of the Society Earl Marshal.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must appoint all Atlantian marshals but may designate Deputy Marshals to appoint Marshals in the Earl Marshal's place.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must appoint Deputies for each Combat Discipline.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal must appoint an Emergency Successor to handle proper transition of the Earl Marshal office in case the Earl Marshal is no longer able to serve.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal will determine and publish the rules and regulations for experimental weapons and other experimental rules.
                    1.  The Earl Marshal is the arbiter for interpretation of all conventions or policies for all disciplines of combat.
                    1.  The Kingdom Marshal will impose sanctions upon those groups failing to comply with fighter practice waiver submissions policies, as appropriate, and will investigate repeated group sanctions for non-compliance with fighter practice waiver submissions policies, in collaboration with the Kingdom Seneschal.
                1.  Deputy Earl Marshal for an Activity (DEM)
                    1.  The DEM must assist the Earl Marshal in creating and maintaining the conventions of the discipline, including:
                        * Equipment standards
                        * Authorization standards
                        * Rules of Engagement
                        * Scoring/Acknowledgement conventions
                        * Safety Rules
                    1.  Conventions produced by a DEM must be approved by the Earl Marshal and published according to policy and/or law before taking effect.
                    1.  In the absence of the EM at an event, the DEM will be the final authority on the interpretation of conventions in their specific discipline.  In extreme cases, the DEM may overrule the MIC of an event, but only if they are not participating in the activity at the time of the dispute.
                    1.  The DEM may appoint assistants, but they will have no official standing within these policies.
                1.  Deputy Kingdom Marshal for Training (DEM-T)
                    1.  The DEM-T will establish a training program that will maintain quality marshal's activities.
                    1.  The DEM-T may designate Deputy Marshals to carry out the training program across the Kingdom.
                    1.  The DEM-T will screen training program applicants. Those applicants accepted will become apprentice marshals.
                1.  Knight's Marshal (KM)
                    1.  Any group that wishes to conduct any marshal related activity at an event must have a Warranted Marshal or sponsorship from a warranted Atlantian Marshal that will assume responsibility for the event. If the Marshal is unable to serve as Marshal in Charge for the event/activity (unable to attend the event, not warranted for the activity, or for some other reason) a warranted marshal must be recruited to serve as MiC.
                    1.  Each group will have at most one Knight's Marshal.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal must ensure that practices are conducted in accordance with SCA corporate policy and the guidelines that are defined in this document and its appendices.  The Knight's Marshal must ensure that the group has a representative marshal present at such practices for all of the disciplines being practiced.  Any one marshal may represent any or all disciplines in which he or she is an authorized marshal.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal should encourage the other marshals in their group to accumulate loaner equipment and do so themselves.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal should encourage the marshals of each discipline in the group to become cross-trained in other disciplines and do so themselves.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal must train new participants in the activities for which the Knight's Marshal is a warranted marshal.  The Knight's Marshal may delegate this responsibility to another marshal as long as that marshal is warranted in that particular discipline.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal must ensure that there is a Marshal-In- Charge (MIC) for each local event that includes any marshal related activity.  In this process, the Knight's Marshal must work with the group's seneschal and the event's autocrat to select a mutually acceptable MIC.  The Knight's Marshal need not be the MIC.
                    1.  The Knight's Marshal shall ensure that the MIC for events hosted by their group files an event report.  A Knight's Marshal that fails in this obligation may be removed from office.
                1.  Deputy Knight's Marshals (DKM)
                    1.  Marshals who have completed the specific training and testing program for a given discipline will become a warranted marshal in that discipline.
                    1.  Warranted marshals with no other role will be assigned as a DKM of their local group.
                    1.  Local groups may have any number of DKMs.
                    1.  The DKMs are deputies of the KM. The DKM must train participants in the disciplines that they are warranted in, upon request by those participants in that discipline.  The DKM may offer assistance, but may not mandate participation in training exercises by any participant.
                    1.  Upon request by the KM or the MIC-Event, the DKM must assist the MIC-Event with the administration of marshaled activities at events sponsored by the DKM's home group.
                1.  Marshal-at-Large (NO LONGER IN USE)
                    1.  The position of Marshal-at-Large is immediately terminated. All Marshals-at-Large in every discipline will be assigned as DKM to their group of residence.
                1.  Apprentice Marshals (also known as Marshals In Training (MITs))
                    1.  Apprentices may not serve in any of the capacities listed above.  They may serve as line marshals with warranted marshals who are training them.
                    1.  Apprentices must meet the requirements listed for all marshals in Item 3.1.3.1.9 (below).
                    1.  Anyone wishing to join the apprenticeship program must send
a written request to the Earl Marshal containing all of his or her contact information.
                    1.  Apprentices must attend at least one marshals' training seminar.
                    1.  Apprentices must make arrangements with a mentor to guide them through the apprenticeship.  This mentor must be a warranted marshal and must be listed in the request for entrance into the apprenticeship program.
                    1.  The apprenticeship program consists of the following:
                        1.  Apprentices must assist in marshalling at least four different events.
                        1.  The apprentice must get the prior approval of the Marshal in Charge for that event.
                        1.  At these events they will assist in all marshal functions.
                        1.  At least two of these events must be outside their local group.
                        1.  At least one of these events must be in a different region of the kingdom.
                        1.  At least one of these events must have significant melee combat.
                    1.  A warranted marshal must supervise all of the apprentices' activities.
                    1.  At the end of the combat activities, the apprentice must get written feedback from the Marshal in Charge.  This must be recorded on the apprenticeship form.
                    1.  After completing the apprenticeship program the apprentice shall send the completed form to the relevant discipline Deputy Earl Marshal.
                    1.  Completion of the apprenticeship program makes the apprentice eligible for a warrant, or warrant-eligible.
                    1.  Warrant-eligible apprentices may be warranted to a vacant knight marshal or deputy knight marshal position and then become warranted.
                1.  Crowd Control Assistants (also known as "line marshals" (CCA))
                    1.  Crowd Control Assistants are only allowed at the discretion of the MIC-Event or the MIC of an Activity.
                    1.  Anyone may be a Crowd Control Assistant.
                    1.  The only activity of the Crowd Control Assistants is the warning of participants and spectators that they are approaching the boundaries of the combat activity.
                    1.  If the MIC deems that any CCA is dangerous, incompetent, or redundant, the MIC may remove the CCA from participation.
                    1.  Warranted marshals must take into account that Crowd Control Assistants may not be completely experienced in safety measures around a given activity and that they should be protected from dangerous situations.
                1.  Responsibilities of all Marshals
                    1.  All marshals must attend an Atlantian Marshal's Seminar in their discipline once every three years. This could be their discipline meeting at Unevent or any marshal's training approved by the Earl Marshal or the appropriate discipline deputy.
                    1.  All marshals must be members of the SCA and receive The Acorn at their place of residence.
                    1.  All marshals must be completely familiar with the SCA Rules of the List, the SCA Marshal's Handbook, and this document.
                    1.  Marshals must provide their names, addresses, phone numbers, email (if any), local group names, membership numbers, and membership expiration to the Earl Marshal.  The Earl Marshal shall be notified when this information changes.
                    1.  Marshals must complete the appropriate training program as set forth by the Earl Marshal.
                    1.  If any officer with the authority (such as the event Autocrat, local, regional, or Kingdom Seneschale) removes sanction from an event, all warranted marshals must leave the site.
            1.  The Roles of the Marshal There are three basic roles that a marshal may play at an event.  They may be the Marshal In Charge of the event (MIC), they may be the Marshal In Charge of an activity, or they may be a regular marshal (*i.e*., has no supervisory role). The responsibility of each role is delineated below:
                1.  Marshal In Charge of an Event (MIC-Event) The MIC-Event is the marshal who is listed on the event registration form filed by the autocrat with the Kingdom Chronicler.  If the marshal listed on the event registration form is unable to fulfill this commitment, they must inform the autocrat and the group's Knight's Marshal as soon as possible.  A new MIC must be identified and the event registration form updated.
                    1.  The MIC-Event shall oversee all combat at an event (including official practices and published demos).
                    1.  The MIC-Event must ensure that for each marshal related activity there is a marshal warranted in that discipline in charge of that activity.
                    1.  The MIC-Event must submit an event report (See Event Reports).
                    1.  Marshals who fail to properly handle their marshal-in-charge commitments will be removed from all marshal positions.
                    1.  MIC-Events may set specialty parameters to certain battles as long as the parameters are within current rules and explained in writing in the event announcement or in flyers at the door.
                    1.  For inter-kingdom events, changes to the conventions of either Kingdom must be published in both Kingdom newsletters as per Society Earl Marshal ruling.
                    1.  MIC-Events must set scenarios, or delegate to a MIC- Discipline.  Note that the event's Autocrat defines the general nature of the scenario; however, all details of the execution of the scenarios are in the purview of the MIC-Event and MIC- Discipline.
                    1.  The MIC-Event must enforce all policies and conventions, and apply problem resolution as needed.
                    1.  The MIC-Event must withdraw sanction from any event where the MIC-Event is unable to halt unsafe or illegal activity.
                    1.  An MIC-Event must have:
                        * A Marshal's Staff
                        * A Marshal's tabard (or other readily identifiable garment)
                        * High-impact eye protection, if missile weapon combat is involved
                        * A copy of this document
                        * A copy of the SCA Marshal's Handbook
                        * A copy of the SCA Rules of the List
                        * A Pen
                        * Paper
                        * A whistle on his/her person while on duty, if large melees are involved
                    1.  The MIC-Event may not participate in any marshal-related activities at the event outside the role of MIC-Event.
                1.  Marshal In Charge of an Activity (MIC-Activity)
                    1.  Each marshal related activity conducted at an event must have a MIC-Activity.
                    1.  The MIC-Activity must be authorized to marshal that discipline.
                    1.  The MIC-Activity must deal with any problems during the discipline activity.  All problems rated significant or severe must be reported to the MIC-Event.
                    1.  The MIC-Activity has the specific right to remove any participant from the Activity.  This is to be treated as a severe problem and reported accordingly.
                    1.  The MIC-Activity must conduct, or assign subordinate marshals to conduct, an inspection of the armor and weapons that will be used by all combatants prior to starting combat activities.
                    1.  Before each activity, the MIC-Activity must ask the combatants if they have had their equipment inspected.  If any equipment has not been inspected the participant must complete the inspection process before starting the activity.
                    1.  The MIC-Activity must attempt a quick visual inspection of all equipment before commencing the activity.  This is not always possible, and does not take the place of proper inspection procedures, or the responsibility of the user to maintain equipment in a compliant status.
                1.  Marshals assisting MIC-Activity
                    1.  These Marshals must be warranted in the discipline over which they are officiating.
            1.  (Deleted and reserved for future policies)
            1.  Participants and Their Responsibilities
                1.  Definition: All individuals who wish to participate in a marshaled combat discipline in Atlantia must either:
                    1.  Have a permanent address within the borders of the Kingdom of Atlantia where the participant receives their Kingdom newsletter and is authorized by the procedures outlined in this document.
                    1.  Be resident in a foreign Kingdom as defined by Corpora and properly authorized by the Marshals of that Kingdom.  Visiting fighters must review with the MIC the Policies and Conventions that apply to the discipline in which they wish to participate.
                1.  Combat Participant Responsibilities
                    1.  All participants must know and follow the current rules.
                    1.  All participants must report to the Minister of Lists and either show proof of waiver on file with the Office of the Registry or execute a waiver.
                    1.  The Marshals assume that all participants believe they are acting in a safe and courteous conduct at all times.  It is the participant's responsibility to demonstrate this by his or her actions before, during, and after the activity.
                    1.  All participants are responsible for conducting themselves in a controlled, courteous, and safe fashion at all times, and must accept the criteria of the Marshals for these characteristics.
                    1.  Participants at events may only participate in activities that they are correctly authorized in, with the exception of authorizing activities.
                    1.  At official practices, participants must either show proof of a waiver on file with the Office of the Registry or complete a waiver of liability and submit it to the MIC of the practice.
                    1.  All participants must have all equipment that they plan to use that day inspected by a Marshal for the activity or the designated Inspecting Marshal (if there is one) before participating in that activity.
                    1.  If the participant has a grievance, resolution will be conducted immediately after the activity by the MIC of that activity, and can be appealed to the MIC-Event by the aggrieved individual.
                    1.  The participant must give truthful information in cases where reports must be made.  Falsification of information may result in termination of all authorizations or other sanctions.
                    1.  All participants, regardless of office or rank, must obey the directions of the Marshals while involved in a marshaled activity.  (NOTE:  This applies to marshals as well.)
            1.  Dishonorable Behavior
                1.  It is understood by the Marshals that all but a tiny fraction of participants in the marshaled activities participate in a spirit of honor, dignity, and chivalry.  However, even with the best intent, participants may behave in a manner contrary to that spirit.  It is the Marshal's responsibility to bring any such behavior to the participant's attention in such a fashion to indicate the above message.  Repeated behavior of unsportsmanlike nature will result in sanction at the Marshal's discretion.  Such unacceptable behaviors will include, but not be limited to:
                    * Verbally abusing or arguing with the Marshals, CCAs, MoLs, Chirurgeons, or Waterbearers
                    * Name calling/taunting of other participants
                    * Pushing or other physical contact
                    * Excessive swearing
                    * Spitting at another participant or a Marshal
                    * Purposefully delaying the activity by any method
                    * Throwing equipment in a fashion that indicates anger or loss of control
                    * Any other behavior the Marshal finds inappropriate on the field
            1.  Holds
                1.  When hold is called, every participant must cease the marshaled activity at once, place their weapons on the ground if applicable, and stand in place, or kneel if directed by the marshal, until directed otherwise by a marshal.
                1.  The marshal for some group combat activities may declare a
"bubble hold" option before the activity begins.  In a bubble hold, the marshal may direct participants around the cause for hold to act as informal line marshals, informing other participants who approach the bubble of the perimeter of the hold.  Participants who are directed in this fashion must hold their equipment in a fashion that will indicate that they are not combat ready, *i.e*., holding a bow horizontal or a sword by the blade.
            1.  Warrants
                1.  Prospective Marshals must undergo an apprenticeship in a specific discipline in order to supervise that discipline.  This requirement may be waived or modified, at the Earl Marshal's or relevant discipline Deputy Earl Marshal's discretion. The Earl Marshal's office encourages all marshals to cross train in as many disciplines as possible.
                1.  A Marshal may not be warranted in disciplines in which they are not authorized to participate.  This requirement may be waived, at the Earl Marshal's discretion.
                1.  Warrants will be kept by roster by the Earl Marshal.
                1.  For Knight's Marshals, warrants will remain in effect for 2 years from the date of issue, unless the warrant is suspended or removed by the Earl Marshal, or another warrant is issued for that position.
                1.  Deputy Knight's Marshal warrants expire upon resignation or termination by the Earl Marshal.
                1.  Kingdom Deputy Marshals serve at the pleasure of the Earl Marshal.
                1.  The Earl Marshal must annually audit the roster, and any individual no longer meeting the required attributes of a Marshal will have his or her warrant terminated.  The KEM must submit the roster of Marshals to the Crown once per reign.  This will usually happen at Curia Regis, or at Coronation on request of the incoming Crown.
            1.  Reporting
                1.  Event Reports An event report must be filed by the MIC-Event within 7 days of each event (except where required to file a special report earlier due to problem resolution) and must include the following information.  Event reports must be filed in writing and must include any supporting documentation as necessary.
                    1.  The name of the Marshal in Charge of the Event submitting the report, and the Minister of the Lists.
                    1.  The name of all marshals (incl. apprentices) and the capacity in which they served.
                    1.  A list of all authorization attempts including weapon form and result.
                    1.  A description of marshal activities for the day, including disciplines represented and scenarios enacted, with an evaluation of the activities for success and safety.
                    1.  A description of any injuries requiring professional medical services.  This is in addition to the requirement for notifying the KEM within 24 hours.
                    1.  A description of problems arising from combat related activities, including the name of offending participants, the nature of the offense, and the resolution.  This report must include any decisions of the marshal's that were overturned by the Crown.
                    1.  Any intervention by higher ranking Marshals (either invited by the MIC or unilateral on the part of the ranking Marshal).
                1.  Fighter Practice Waivers: Any waiver signed during the course of official local fighter practices shall be collected from the marshals- in-charge of fighter practices by the Knight's Marshal of the hosting group on a monthly basis.
                    1.  All fighter practice waivers and a fighter practice waiver report form will be submitted by the Knight's Marshal of the hosting group to the Kingdom Waiver Secretary on a quarterly basis, in accordance with the following schedule:  Quarterly fighter practice materials are due April 15 (for fighter practices held between January 1 -- March 31); July 15 (April 1 -- June 30); October 15 (July 1 -- September 30); and January 15 (October
1 -- December 31).
                    1.  In the event that no fighter practice waivers have been collected at official local fighter practices, a fighter practice waiver report indicating this will be submitted by the Knight's Marshal of the group on the above schedule.  An electronic fighter practice waiver report may be accepted at the discretion of the Kingdom Waiver Secretary in the event that no waivers have been collected.
                1.  Filing Reports Reports may be filed by US Mail; UPS (or other delivery service which does not require a signature for delivery); by email to the Earl Marshal at EarlMarshal@atlantia.sca.org; or by a form in the appropriate section of the Atlantian Marshal's Website. Reports may be filed by other methods on a case-by-case basis, but only with the approval of the Earl Marshal.  These methods may include fax, same day delivery requiring signature, or hand delivery to the Earl Marshal.
                1.  Incident Reports Anyone may file an incident report for any problem that they perceive in the execution of combat activities.  This includes: reports by participants about marshals at an event, reports about participants by participants at an event, reports by marshals about participants outside events (specifically including practices announced in the group newsletter), and reports by marshals (other than the MIC-Event) concerning problems with other marshals.  The following guidelines govern incident reports:
                     * Incident reports must be filed within 7 days of the incident
                    * Incident reports must include the name of the filing individual
                    * The name of the offending individuals (if appropriate)
                    * The names of witnesses (if any)
                    * The specific description of the problem with a reference to Policy or Law to demonstrate the offense. The Earl Marshal will evaluate the Incident report for action.  If the Earl Marshal finds that the incident has merit, he will act on it as the equivalent of a "severe problem" as described in the section on Problem Resolution.
                1.  Deadlines
                    1.  If a report is not turned in by the deadline, the marshal will be placed on suspension for a period of not less than 90 days, during which time s/he may not perform any marshal activities including (but not limited to):
                        * Authorizations
                        * Armor and weapon inspections
                        * Marshaling a fight
                        * Marshaling a practice
                        * Serving as MIC of any event
                    1.  Following a second offense, the marshal's warrant will be revoked for a minimum of one year.
                    1.  Failure to report may negate any sanctions or authorizations at the discretion of the Earl Marshal.
    1. Problem Resolution

        During all activities, the Marshals running that activity must enforce the rules governing participation.  Infractions fall into one of three categories defined below. When a violation occurs, the marshal shall use the following guidelines to attempt to resolve the issue(s).
        * Ordinary:  The vast majority of violations will be transitory single occurrences. These should be noted, but not be the subject of action during the activity.  The marshal should discuss the problem with the individual or group after the activity ceases.
        * Significant:  If there is a pattern of violations, or if there is a safety hazard, the marshal shall stop the activity, if it is a single bout.  In a group activity, the marshal should pull the participant aside if possible without stopping the activity. Circumstances may make this inadvisable without a hold.  Although it is desirable to allow activities to run while problems are resolved, this may not be allowed to compromise the need for safe management of the activity.

            The Marshal will clearly, concisely, and courteously explain the violation to the combatant.  The MIC of that activity may remove the combatant from participation in the duration of the activity, or from the next scheduled activity. The Marshal will clearly communicate that the violation must not be repeated.  The Marshal will inform the erring combatant that report of this action will be in the event report.
        * Severe:  These are severe safety hazards, a continuing pattern of violations, or an injury requiring medical attention.

            The MIC of an activity must order the participant to leave the activity area and prohibit that participant from any further activity either for that day or the duration of the event.  In head to head competitive activity this is treated as a lost bout.  In scored activities, the score accrued before ejection becomes null and void.  During group activities, the activity continues without the sanctioned participant.  (No resurrection allowed.) In all three of the above situations, the MIC-Activity must inform the MIC-Event at the end of the activity about the violations and any actions taken.  In the case of an injury, the activity must be stopped until the injured participant can safely be removed for medical assistance.  If the injury requires off-site medical assistance, the MIC must record the name of the emergency service or hospital used in the MIC report.  The MIC must inform the KEM within 24 hours by telephone.
        1.  MIC Responsibilities and Powers The MIC-Event must assess any problems for immediate action.
            1.  The MIC must immediately record, on paper, all significant or severe problems and include them in the event report.
            1.  In the case of severe or continuing problems, the MIC may remove the participant from further participation in any activity for the remainder of the event.
            1.  If the MIC feels that the participant represents an ongoing problem or danger s/he must suspend the authorization of the participant.
        1.  Suspension The suspension of any one Authorization by the MIC-Event will also be a suspension of a participant's authorization in all disciplines until resolution by the Earl Marshal.
            1.  The MIC-Event will physically take possession of the participant's authorization card.
            1.  If the combatant does not cooperate that is an additional violation.
            1.  The MIC must complete the event report immediately after the event.
            1.  The MIC must contact the Earl Marshal by email or telephone within two days of the end of the last activity of an event.
            1.  The MIC must send copies of the event report to both the Earl Marshal and Minister of Lists.
            1.  Suspensions last until lifted or replaced by the Earl Marshal.
        1.  Review and Investigation
            1.  The Earl Marshal will begin a review of any authorization suspension immediately upon receipt of the report.
                1.  The Earl Marshal may lift the authorization suspension.
                1.  The suspension may be left in place during further consideration.
        1.  The Earl Marshal may designate an investigator for serious rules violations.
            1.  The investigator will gather information and make recommendations.
            1.  This initial investigation must take less than 15 days.
            1.  After reviewing the investigator's recommendations the Earl Marshal will take any action at his/her sole discretion, including dropping the matter.
        1.  Marshal's Court For the resolution of serious problems, the Earl Marshal may either convene a Marshal's Court or begin a summary problem resolution (see below).
            1.  The Earl Marshal may not unilaterally levy sanctions more severe than suspension without such sanctions being recommended by a Marshal's Court.
            1.  The Marshal's Court will consist of three to five marshals and may not include the Earl Marshal.
            1.  The Marshal's Court shall determine their deliberative process with due regard to Fairness.
            1.  The sanctions imposed by a Marshal's Court may include, but are not limited to, the following sanctions:
                 * An official reprimand. This must be paired with a required public written apology by the offending participant, which must be published in the Acorn.
                * The suspension of all authorizations for a fixed period.
                * Recommendation of the permanent revocation of all authorizations.
                * The suspension of a specific weapon authorization for a fixed period.
                * A restriction of activity, such as no melees.
                * Recommendation of banishment, permanent or fixed period, from the lists.
                * The revocation of a marshal's warrant.
                * Probation: Probation may include special requirements to address the problem but the offender must agree to the conditions of the probation.  The results of violations of probation must be specific.
            1.  Appeals of the Marshal's Court decisions may be appealed to the Society level.
            1.  The Marshal's Court may make the following recommendations (to the Crown):
                1.  A Court of Chivalry
                1.  A Court of Courtesy
                1.  Banishment of all types
                1.  Revocation of rank and awards.
        1.  Summary Problem Resolution
            1.  The Earl Marshal may involve the subject of an investigation in a summary resolution process.
            1.  The Earl Marshal and the subject must both agree to an open ended summary resolution.  The subject agrees to an abbreviated process run directly by the Earl Marshal.
            1.  Fixed summary resolution results from an agreement between the Earl Marshal and the subject specifying the violations and the sanctions.  The fixed summary resolution must be specified in writing and signed by both the Earl Marshal and the subject.  There are no limitations on the terms of this problem resolution.
            1.  Once the subject and the Earl Marshal agree to either an open ended or fixed summary resolution, any Marshal's Court shall be terminated.
        1.  External Problems
            1.  Marshals at all levels may have to deal with problems beyond the combatants and the Marshals.
            1.  In all such cases the marshals are expected to work with the appropriate officers to resolve such problems. Example:  A child gets too close to the fighting.  The first time, the marshal calls hold and directs the child out of the way.  If the problem recurs, the marshal must find and counsel the parent.  If the problem continues, the marshal must work with the autocrat to have the child removed from the area of the combat.
        1.  Complaints and Appeals
            1.  Complaints or grievances by marshals or participants must be submitted in writing within 15 days of the last activity of an event using an incident report form such as that furnished in the Reports Appendix or the Marshals Web Page.
            1.  Participants' appeals of sanctions must be made in writing, postmarked within 15 days of the MIC-Events sanction.
            1.  All submissions must be typed or printed out and must be signed and dated. Electronic submissions must be followed within 15 days of the last activity of an event by typed or printed copies which are signed and dated.
    1. Training
        1.  Deputy Earl Marshal for Training The proficiency of the Marshallate is one of the primary concerns of the Earl Marshal.  In order to foster professionalism and competency, the Deputy Earl Marshal for Training (DEM-Training) position has been created.  The DEM- Training shall be responsible for:
            1.  Creating and maintaining instructional material.
            1.  Planning and staffing the track of marshalling classes at each session of the University of Atlantia.
            1.  Working with the other Deputy Earl Marshals to be sure that the available curricula address the specific needs of that discipline.
            1.  Training senior marshals in the prepared materials to enable them to serve as instructors.
    1. Authorization
        1.  Armored Combat Authorization Procedures
            1.  Authorization is designed to ensure that all fighters are able to conduct themselves in a safe and courteous manner while on the field of combat.
            1.  The authorization process ensures that all fighters taking the field are conducting themselves according to a common standard.
            1.  This process also ensures the minimal level of proficiency necessary to ensure that they do not present a threat to themselves or anyone else on the field.
            1.  All combatants in tournaments and melees in Atlantia must be authorized in the weapons they wish to use.
            1.  Visitors to Atlantia may participate at Atlantian events if they go over the Atlantian rules with an Atlantian marshal before they compete.
            1.  Fighters with a valid authorization from another kingdom who move into Atlantia may trade in for an Atlantian authorization card.  See the Policies of the MoL for the procedure.
        1.  Who May Become Authorized
            1.  To become authorized a fighter must meet the following requirements.
                * Be at least 16 years old.
                * Combatants under the age of 18 have additional authorization requirements described in the minor authorization procedures.
                * Thorough familiarity with all weapon and armor standards, conventions of combat, and other rules concerning combat related activities in Atlantia.
                * Complete an authorization.
        1.  Where Can Someone Go Through the Authorization Procedure
            1.  All armored combat authorizations will be held either at an SCA event or at fighter's practice.
            1.  Marshals wishing to conduct authorizations at practice must obtain prior permission to do so from the Deputy Earl Marshal for Armored Combat, and coordinate MOL support to insure all reporting standards, both for MICs and for MOLs, are adhered to.
        1.  When Can Authorization Occur
            1.  Authorizations can be held at any time during the course of the event. When a combatant authorizes during an event they may participate in subsequent activities as allowed by their new authorization.
        1.  Marshals
            1.  At least one of the marshals must live in a different local group from the candidate.  If the candidate lives in a barony, at least one of the marshals must live outside that barony.
            1.  At least one marshal MUST be authorized in the applicable weapons form.
            1.  Inspect the armor and equipment of all personnel participating in the authorization process.
            1.  Test the knowledge of the candidate regarding the applicable rules governing combat in Atlantia.
            1.  The knowledge test should include questions applicable to the weapons being used in the authorization.
            1.  Inform the participants in the authorization of how the authorization is to be conducted.
            1.  Ensure that both combatants' armor is legal.
            1.  Neither of the marshals may be fighters who regularly practice with the candidate.
                1.
        1.  Authorization for Minors In order for anyone who is 16 or 17 years old to become an authorized fighter in Atlantia outside of Youth Combat, the following procedure must be followed.
            1.  The candidate must have either a Minor waiver on file at SCA Corporate Headquarters (blue membership card) or must complete a SCA 'Minor's Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement (General Waiver for Minors)'.
            1.  For a minor to fight or even practice, either a parent or legal guardian shall be present, or someone holding a notarized Medical Authorization for Minors granting them authority to approve medical treatment shall be present.
            1.  During early training, those who are running the practice must make careful determination as to the minor's physical and emotional maturity.  The variations among minors are considerable.  At this age, many are unready, either physically or emotionally, for SCA combat.  The marshals must be conservative in this respect.  If there is any question, remember that if the minor is truly emotionally ready, they will not react inappropriately to being told to wait a year.  If the marshal is not sure that the minor is ready, they must be told to wait a year.
            1.  The local marshal will arrange for at least one of the parents or legal guardians to observe the fighting practice.  Every attempt should be made to ensure that the parents leave with a familiarity with SCA fighting.
            1.  The minor must attend at least one fighting event before the event at which the minor attempts to authorize.
            1.  The parents or legal guardians shall be asked to come to an event before authorization.
            1.  A standard authorization will be conducted with at least one of the officiating marshals being the Earl Marshal or designated Deputy Earl Marshal.
            1.  All of the paperwork involved in the minor's authorization must be reviewed by the Earl Marshal or designated Deputy Earl Marshal before being processed by the Minister of Lists.
            1.  The front half of the helms and masks of sixteen and seventeen year olds who participate in combat activities, either as armored, rapier or equestrian combatants, combat archers or siege engineers, must be clearly marked with three green dots, no less than 1" in diameter, arranged in a triangular formation forming a trefoil.
    1. Weapons and Armor Standards
        1. Appearance on the List Field. All equipment or clothing used by participants on the list field must either have a pre-17th Century appearance or be covered in a manner to present such an appearance.
            1. The purpose of this law is not to exclude participants from the list, but to encourage the historical appearance of events. These rules shall be applied with discretion and good judgment to encourage rather than to discourage.
            1. Participants who are residents of another kingdom are considered our guests and are exempt from this ruling provided they meet Society minimum standards.
            1. Newly transplanted subjects of Atlantia are to be granted a four month period of time to come into compliance with these laws.
            1. For specifics and examples of this requirement, please refer to the Earl Marshal’s Web Site – http://marshal.atlantia.sca.org/.
        1.  Armored Combat Weapons and Armor Standards
            1.  Armor Regulations. Atlantia uses the SCA regulations without additions.
            1.  Armor Inspections. All participants must have their arms and armor inspected by a warranted marshal before participating in combat at each event, practice, or other official activity.
            1.  Weapon Inspections. The marshal in charge of each bout should visually inspect weapons before each bout unless they are using a method of marking already inspected weapons.  Questionable weapons must be physically inspected prior to combat commencing.  For simple swords, these checks should be extremely brief.  Marshals should pay more attention to padded weapons and thrusting tips.
            1.  Weapon Regulations. Atlantia uses the SCA regulations with the following additions:
                1.  Polearms
                    1.
A polearm shall be constructed so as to emulate a medieval example.  Allowable examples of a medieval emulation would be a padded head in the form of a period weapon, or a split-rattan head in the form of a period weapon.
                    1.   Atlantia defines an excessively flexible polearm as one that allows the head of the weapon to strike a telling blow to a target despite the intercession of an unyielding block to the haft of the weapon.
                1.  Greatswords
                    1.  Greatswords must be 6' or less in overall length
                    1.  The grip must be 18" or less.
                    1.  The portion of the great sword above the quillons (called a ricasso) may be left without edge markings and therefore can be grasped.
                1.  Spears may not be more than 9 feet long overall.
                    1.   Mandrake style 2" tips are no longer acceptable as thrusting tips on fiberglass spears. Section VII-D-5 of the Society's Marshal's Handbook is no longer valid in Atlantia.
                1.  Offensive shields are prohibited
                1.  During combat, the blade of the sword may not be grasped. Also the striking surface of a mass weapon or thrusting tip may not be grasped.
                1.  Single-handed weapons shall not be constructed so as to place a thrusting tip or butt spike within four inches of a rigid structure such as a basket hilt, metal pommel, or steel-gauntleted hand.
        1.  Combat Archery Weapons and Armor Standards
            1.  Armor Regulations.
                1.  Armor standards for combat archers are the same as those for armored combat participants except that Demi Gauntlets may be worn on one or both hands in place of the full Gauntlets.
                1.  When utilized in conjunction with rapier combat, rapier armor standards shall apply. This removes the white diamond rules.
            1.  Weapons Regulations. All combat archery weapons (including projectiles) must meet the requirements of the SCA Missile Combat Rules.  The following additional requirements apply in Atlantia:
                1.  Arrows/bolts may have a base construction of a fiberglass shaft or Siloflex tubing as described in the SCA Marshals Handbook. All fiberglass shafts must be longitudinally covered with a filament strapping tape and are required to have an 'approved' Anti- Penetration Device (APD) IAW the Society Marshal's Handbook. Shafted arrows/bolts are not required to have APDs when used in Rapier Combat.
                1.  Fiberglass shaft arrows/bolts may utilize Baldar Blunt, CUBB and UHMW heads. CUBB and Baldar blunts shall not be used in Rapier Combat.  All ammo used on the rapier field shall have no less than 1 inch of resilient padding after taping. This must be added in front of the blunt and be at least the same diameter as the blunt.
                1.  Siloflex arrows may be gleaned and fired again. A warranted marshal must inspect all other arrows prior to reuse. All arrows shall be clearly marked for identification with the name of the user, home branch and kingdom
    1. Conventions of Combat
        1.  Conventions of Combat for Armored Combat
            1.  Target Areas.
                1.  Torso: All of the torso above the point of the hips including the shoulder blades and the area between the neck and shoulder will be considered part of the torso.
                1.  Face: The area between the collarbones and the mid brow and between the side burns.
                1.  Head: The whole head and the neck except the face (as defined above).
                1.  Hips: Begin with a line even with the bottom of the groin up to the point of the hip.
                1.  Thighs: The leg from one inch above the top of the knee up to a line even with the bottom of the groin.
                1.  Shoulder: From the point of the shoulder down to a line even with the top of the underarm.
                1.  Arms: From the shoulder to one inch above the wrist.
            1.  Targeting.
                1.  Blows landed outside the target areas need not be counted.
                1.  A fighter may not intentionally strike areas outside the target areas.
                1.  A fighter may not intentionally strike with the non-striking surface of a weapon (haft, hilt, etc.).
            1.  Telling Blows.
                1.  A blow that strikes a legal target area with telling force will be acknowledged.
                1.  Telling force is determined by evaluating the blow against the SCA standard of fully armored.
                1.  Fully armored is interpreted to mean wearing authentic medieval armor consisting of an open-faced helm and a fully riveted chain mail hauberk covering the torso, shoulders, and thighs.  The arm and leg armor is covered by boiled leather armor.  Blows that would incapacitate through this armor are telling blows.
                1.  The exact force level necessary to meet this standard is determined by each fighter but must be within the normal range defined by all Atlantian fighters.
                1.  Missile weapons must strike the same targets as thrusting weapons. But, any contact from a projectile is considered a telling blow.
                1.  Blows striking a weapon or shield before striking a target will be considered a telling blow if the force of the blow after striking the intervening shield or weapon is sufficient to be a telling blow.
                1.  Blows in which the weapon is dropped upon impact may be discounted.
                1.  Blows in which a weapon strikes a combatant because it physically breaks upon striking the shield or defensive weapon need not be counted.
                1.  Blows struck with the non-striking portion of the weapons shall not be counted (haft, hilt, etc.).
            1.  Results of Telling Blows.
                1.  Telling blows to the face, head, or torso are considered killing.
                1.  Telling blows from a swung mace, great sword, or pole arm to the hip or shoulder are killing.
                1.  All other blows are wounding blows.
                1.  Projectiles have the same effect as thrusts.
                1.  Thrusts to the head, outside of the face, are not telling blows and need not be counted.
            1.  Death.
                1.  After receiving a killing blow the fighter will cease throwing blows.
                1.  After receiving a killing blow the fighter will fall to the ground
                    **or in some other way clearly indicate he has been defeated.**
                1.  In single combat the bout is ended after a killing blow (except double kills).
                1.  When both fighters, in a one-on-one bout, are killed, they either fight the bout over starting from mutually unwounded conditions or, both take the bout as a loss, depending on the scenario.
            1.  Wounds.
                1.  Wounding blows to the shoulder or arm will cause the loss of the use of that arm.
                1.  The wounded arm may not be used to block or throw blows.
                1.  A second telling blow to that arm or shoulder will be a killing blow.
                1.  Wounding blows to a thigh or hip will cause the fighter to fight from his knees.
                1.  The fighter must keep one knee on the ground unless he hops.
                1.  Hopping is allowed if the fighter puts no weight on the wounded limb.
                1.  Hopping is frequently used to throw one blow after being dealt a wounding blow.
                1.  This must be done without putting any weight on the wounded limb.
            1.  Interruptions.
                1.  Any blow started before any interruption of combat (such as death or a hold) will count as if they landed before the interruption.
            1.  Starting Combat.
                1.  Combat will be started when the marshals call lay-on.
                1.  Except special scenarios fighters should start fights well out of range.
            1.  Holds.
                1.  Effect of a Hold
                    1.  All combatants must immediately cease throwing blows.
                    1.  They must stop moving about the field.
                    1.  Fighters should not drop their guard until all fighters have stopped throwing blows.
                    1.  Combatants may call Hold when any unsafe situation develops.  For example, a fighter should call hold if his helm comes off.
                1.  Calling a Hold
                    1.  In single combat, hold will be called when a fighter is not capable of defense. In single combat, defenseless is defined as having no weapons in hand.
                    1.  If a fighter falls, or if any portion of a hand, arm, or a part of the upper torso or head touches the ground the fighter is considered defenseless.  A fighter who feels that he is not defenseless in any of the above conditions may ask the marshals not to call hold in a specific circumstance.  If the marshal feels that the request would not create a dangerous situation he will not call hold in the specified situation.
            1.  Use of Weapons.
                1.  All weapons to be used in a particular bout of single combat will be declared to the opponent and the marshal before the fight.
                1.  If an auxiliary weapon is carried in such a way as to prevent proper acknowledgment of a blow, any blow striking the weapon will be considered a telling blow to the area that would have been hit.
                1.  Except for the proper use of a weapon, grasping, pushing, or striking an opponent is not allowed.
                1.  Striking, pushing, or pressing an opponent's shield with a hand, weapon, or shield is allowed.
                1.  If the opponent has an edged weapon, striking, pushing, or pressing an opponent's weapon's striking portion (regardless of the orientation of the edge) with any part of the body (for example grabbing a sword with the hand) is not allowed.
                1.  Weapon strikes with excessive force are not allowed. Blows with force levels that significantly exceed that necessary to be a telling blow, and significantly increase the chance of substantial injury are blows with excessive force.
            1.  Helms.
                1.  If a fighter's helm comes off or their visor opens during combat, the fight will be stopped and combatant declared dead.  The combatant may not fight again until some steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the problem.  A marshal will inspect the helm before it is used again.
            1.  Engagement. These rules apply to melee combat only. In one on one combat fighters are always considered to be engaged.
                1.  A fighter may only attack opponents they are engaged with.
                1.  To engage an opponent a fighter must establish eye contact and be in front of the opponent.
                1.  A fighter may not attack an opponent that cannot see them.
                1.  All fighters must attempt to engage all fighters who are attempting to engage them.  The simplest way to meet this requirement is to back up until all those attempting to engage are in front of the fighter they are trying to engage.
                1.  If a combatant is engaged and then turns their back, or if they are charging past an opponent, the opponent may throw one blow immediately after the combatant turns away.
                1.  After that, contact has been broken and the combatant must be engaged again.
                1.  A defenseless combatant may not be struck. In melees, defenseless is having no weapons and no shield in hand.
                1. An otherwise defenseless person who remains an active
                    **line, grabbing spears or blocking enemy movement, etc. will **
                    **not be considered defenseless and may be stuck.**
            1.  Melees. Individual battles may have their own particular rules and

                conventions besides those stated in this document as long as those rules do not conflict with any of the rules governing combat.
                1.  No more than four fighters shall attack a single opponent.
                1.  When a fighter is a member of a formed unit (like a shield wall) that is fighting another formed unit, they may strike and be struck by any opponent in that unit.  If a breakthrough occurs in a segment of the unit, fighters in that segment may both attack and be attacked by passing opponents.
                1.  A fighter who is struck a telling blow by someone on their side must acknowledge the blow.
                1.  A hold will not be called for fighters who lose their weapon in melee.
        1.  Conventions of Combat for Combat Archery
            1.  The legal target area for projectile weapons shall be same as any thrusting weapon that is legal in a given scenario.  Exception: At the discretion of the MIC, projectile strikes to the face may be made legal, even in scenarios where face thrusts are prohibited.
            1.  Archers shall not fire at a combatant if the arrow/bolt cannot leave the bow before contact with the target. For rapier combat, crossbows and handbows shall not fire at a combatant at a range of less than 15 feet.
            1.  On the cry of hold or when slain, all arrows will be unnocked, and crossbows will be uncocked.
            1.  Any projectile that strikes a legal target area, unimpeded and point first, shall be considered as telling.  Any projectile that is blocked, deflected, or which strikes in any manner other than point (or edge) first need not be counted.
            1.  Any bow which is struck by a projectile or melee weapon shall be considered as broken and unusable until a qualified marshal inspects the bow. A qualified marshal is a warranted combat archery marshal or a warranted target archery marshal.
            1.  Safety Area for Combat Archery will be a minimum of 10 yards from combat area for non-combatant area.
            1. For rapier combat, rapier conventions of combat are to be used. In addition, maximum draw weight for crossbows in rapier will be 550 inch/pounds.
            1.  A combat archer (or any other combatant) may yield. If a combatant yields, then he should not be touched.
            1.  Engagement with missile weapons: An archer need not have eye contact with an opponent in order to shoot at them, but should be able to see their face or the front of their body when targeting them.  Inadvertent strikes in the back (such as when the target turns away after the missile is loosed, or when the missile strikes an unintended enemy or friendly target) still count if they are recognized, but it should be expected that, in some cases, the target may not realize they have been struck.

The left elbow behind the shield must have the point and bones at either side of the elbow covered by rigid material underlain with at least �" (6mm) of closed-cell foam or equivalent padding. The shield may assist in providing this coverage, but is unlikely to be capable of providing full coverage by itself.
                1.  All riders must make left shoulder to left shoulder passes on the tilt barrier and carry the lance in their right hand regardless of the rider's dominant hand.
                1.  Jousting shields should have at least 165 square inches of surface area (nominally 12" x 14") to present a reasonable minimum target area to the opponent.
                1.  An equestrian combat marshal must marshal the joust. The marshal of the field shall arrange ground crew appropriate to the circumstances. This should include suitable line judges for scoring, and ground crew to prepare lances for each pass and to assist with the replacement and cleanup of broken tips and tubes.
                1.  Each rider shall be responsible for checking his or her equipment prior to commencing a match. The marshal of the field should also check the equipment and the field conditions.
                1.  Riders should have three lances available in order to be able to place one at the distant end of the list for those times when riders are not returning to a "home end" after each pass.
                1.  Once the match is announced each rider should proceed to their end of the tilting lane and prepare for the pass. After the marshal of the field has indicated to the riders that the list is ready for the pass, once both riders have signaled their readiness, they may make the pass.  Jousting is to be done at the trot or higher.
                1.  If a rider is having difficulty controlling his or her horse or equipment, or does not follow the conventions of the list, the marshal should suspend further passes until the situation is addressed. Remember safety is the first priority in this activity.

    1. Target Archery
        1.  Atlantia uses the Society Target Archery Rules, found at: http://sca.org/ with the following changes & clarifications:
        1.  Equipment Standards
            1.  Marshals may make exceptions to the equipment standards on a temporary

                basis for new archers & children. These exceptions must be reported to the Deputy Kingdom Earl Marshal for Target Archery. No one falling under these exceptions can win a competition or score official rounds.
            1.  Compound bows and compound crossbows are not allowed.
            1.  Center-shot crossbows are not allowed. A center-shot crossbow is where the bolt passes through the prod, or between two parts of a split prod. It does not matter how little of a center-shot this is.
            1.  Non-period trackless crossbows are not allowed. Trackless crossbows have their string suspended in mid-air, and do not ride on a shelf.
            1.  Crossbows with a modern pistol grip, modern rifle or air-rifle-style stock are not allowed.
            1.  Bow quivers (ones that attach to the bow or crossbow) are not allowed.
        1.  Procedure & Marshalling Standards
            1.  Equipment Inspection
                1.  At all SCA activities, bows & ammo must be inspected by the marshal in charge or their designee before being used.
                1.  Hand bows should be brought to the marshal unstrung. Crossbows can be left strung.
                1.  At an event with 20 or more archers, stickers shall be used to mark bows that have been inspected.
                1.  Marshals shall not inspect their own equipment, unless they are the only marshal present.
            1.  Safety Zones
                1.  Safety zones need to be clearly marked off. However, visually obvious safety zones (such as a field full of targets with ample space between them), are allowable.
                1.  At a minimum, each shooting station will have a safety zone that extends 30 degrees from each end of the shooting line to a line even with the furthest target, or 50 yards, whichever is closer. The zone will then extend straight back from those points for 40 yards, or half the distance from the shooting line to the target, whichever is greater. A larger safety zone is recommended if possible.
                1.  Physical barriers such as a hill, permanent solid backstop, a wall, etc can be used to reduce the amount of safety zone needed. However, the barrier must completely cover the safety zone in order to count. A small barrier that could be shot around is not sufficient.
                1.  Archery netting can not be used to reduce safety ranges, but is encouraged to help archers recover missed arrows.
            1.  Bows & Crossbows may not be carried downrange.
            1.  A marshal may shoot while marshalling upon their own discretion based upon the current situation.
            1.  The Atlantian Royal Round is used as the official ranking system of Atlantian archers. Specific rules on running this shoot, and recording the scores, are found at the Kingdom Archery website: http://archery.atlantia.sca.org/
            1.  An archery marshal from each local group must send reports quarterly about the state of archery within their group, and after each event to the Deputy Kingdom Earl Marshal for Target Archery.
        1.  Traditional Rulings. Archery has a long tradition in Atlantia. Many standards have developed that archers are used to obeying. When these standards are changed without warning, situations may occur. Therefore, the following rulings shall be considered always in effect, UNLESS the marshal running the particular shoot specifies otherwise. Marshals are encouraged, but not required, to publish any changes to these rulings in advance.
            1.  Archers are to straddle the shooting line. Those that sit, kneel, etc are to keep the point of their ammo in the same line as the standing archers when at full draw.
            1.  When an arrow breaks or just touches a dividing line between two scoring zones on a target, it should be scored in the archer's favor.
            1.  On speed/timed shoots, the call to shoot shall begin with the command
'loose', and end with the command 'hold'. Archer's may fire from the 'L' of loose, to the 'D' of hold. For each arrow let loose before or after this timing, the archer will forfeit the highest scoring arrow on the target.
            1.  During a timed shoot that calls out multiple targets, the archer may loose a shaft at the last target called until the next target is called. This means that an arrow might be fired at the first target then hit after the second target has been called, but still be considered good.
            1.  When archers are grouped by their Atlantian Rank, it is by the archer's current average (not permanent rank) for the bow type that the archer is shooting that day. An archer who knows that they are shooting better than their current average indicates, may wish to let the marshal know this and place them in a higher category.
            1.  Archers are allowed to switch bows during a competition.
            1.  Firing more than one shaft at a time is allowed. Archers must demonstrate competency in this technique to the marshal prior to performing it.
    1. Thrown Weapons
        1.  Thrown Weapon regulations are per the Society regulations, which can be found a[t http://www.sca.org.](http://www.sca.org/)
    1. Rapier Combat
        1.  Rapier Authorization Procedures

                1.  In addition to the Society requirements, all heavy rapier and cut and thrust blade tips must include adequate protection against punch-through of the blade. This may include:
                    * A metal disc (such as a washer) placed between the end of the blade and the tip.

                    * Any approach specifically approved by the Deputy Earl Marshal for Rapier Combat.
        1.  Conventions of Combat for Rapier Combat
            1.  Definitions.
                1.  A Valid Blow is any thrust with positive force towards the opponent in line with the blade or any draw cut using at least 8" of the blade.

                1.  Blow calling is the sole responsibility of the fighter receiving the blows.  Fighters may, at their discretion, call blows good outside of those required.  For example, they may decide to take tip cuts and/or push cuts.
        1.  Rules of the List for Rapier Combat
            1.  A combatant may decline any challenge without dishonor, and without specifying a reason.  In a tournament bout, this may result in forfeiture of the bout.
